# PagesBreadcrumbsWrapper
**NOTE**: This is a newer component of GG previous breadcrumbs. These breadcrumbs are designed to be used at the page level and not in header. These are new classnames as well.

**See the `<PageBreadcrumbs/>` component for an opinionated plug and play version**

The `<PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>` component helps when you need more customization than what the `<Breadcrumbs/>` component provides, use it together with the `<Breadcrumb>` component to get the desired styles or pass your own.

## Full Example
Create a custom array of breadcrumbs and pass it to the component:

```jsx
class Header extends Component {
    state = {
        breadcrumbs: [
            {
                title: 'Home',
                to: '/'
            },
            {
                title: 'Publishers',
                to: '/publishers'
            },
            {
                title: 'Some Publisher',
                to: '/publishers/123'
            },
            {
                title: 'Random Page',
                to: '/random-route/123'
            }
        ]
    };

    render() {
        const { breadcrumbs } = this.state;

        return (
            <div>
                <PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>
                    {breadcrumbs.map(({ title, to }, index) => (
                        <PageBreadcrumb
                            key={to}
                            linkComponent={Link}
                            title={title}
                            path={to}
                            isLast={index === breadcrumbs.length - 1}
                        />
                    ))}
                </PageBreadcrumbsWrapper>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```
