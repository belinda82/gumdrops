# Tabs

`<Tabs>` is as a header that allows to update the content of a page based on the selected option.

By default, `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` are used to navigate to the selected path (composed of topPath + option's path).
Meaning it has to be used within a `<Router>` context if you are using this default option.

To bypass that and use instead a variable in your component, pass a function to `onClick` to know when to update the value.
```
<Tabs
    location={currentTab}
    options={tabOptions}
    onClick(path => doSomething(path))
/>
```

A tab is active when the `location` endsWith a tab's `path`. To override this, use `isTabActive`
```
<Tabs
    topPath="/top"
    location={currentLocation} // currentLocation = "/top/tab-2/abc?someVar=123"
    options={[
        { name: 'Tab 1', path: '/tab-1'},
        { name: 'Tab 2', path: '/tab-2'}
    ]}
    isTabActive={path => currentLocation.includes(path)}
/>
```
